A calling convention primer
---------------------------
In order to standardize the way functions are called, we use a calling
convention. Calling conventions are rules governing how stacks are arranged,
how parameters are passed to functions, and how values are returned by
functions. The details for a calling convention are mostly arbitrary. In CS
2110, we use the LC3 calling convention, defined by the author of the textbook.

There are two sides to a calling convention. The first is what must be done by
the code that is making a function call; this is the caller side. The second is
what must be done by the function itself; this is the callee side. They both
must follow the calling convention for everything to properly work.

Global rules:

    R5 = Frame pointer; points to location of first local variable in current
         frame.
    R6 = Stack pointer; points to the last used location on the stack

    +-------------------+
    | Local variable 2  | <- R6 points here after allocating space for locals
    +-------------------+
    | Local variable 1  | <- R5 points here during the function call
    +-------------------+
    | Old frame pointer | <- R6 points here while setting up the stack
    +-------------------+
    | Return address    |
    +-------------------+
    | Return value      | <- R6 points here after the function returns
    +-------------------+
    | First parameter   | <- R6 points here when the user calls the function
    +-------------------+
    | Last parameter    |
    +-------------------+

    Since R6 points to the last used location on the stack, here are examples
    for pushing and popping values with the stack:

        ADD R6, R6, -1
        STR R0, R6, 0 ; Push R0 onto the stack

        LDR R1, R6, 0
        ADD R6, R6, 1 ; Pop value off the stack into R1

Caller side:

    Set up:

        1. Push parameters in reverse order onto the stack
        2. Use JSR/JSRR to call the function

        Example: See lab13.asm

    Clean up:

        1. R6 is now one space higher on the stack than it was when you JSR'd
        2. Retrieve the return value from the function
        3. Pop the return value and parameters off the stack by subtracting
           from R6

        Example: See lab13.asm

Callee side:

    Set up:

        1. Move R6 up 3 spaces since we're using them for our stack frame
        2. Store our return address (which is in R7) on the stack at R6 + 1
        3. Store our old frame pointer (R5 value) on the stack at R6 + 0
        4. Set our new frame pointer to the location one above R6
        5. Move R6 up however many local variables you have

        Example:

            ADD R6, R6, -3
            STR R7, R6, 1
            STR R5, R0, 0
            ADD R5, R6, -1
            ADD R6, R6, -2 ; Change this to however many locals there are!

    Clean up:

        1. At some point, the function must store return value to R5 + 3
        2. Set R6 to point to the return value
        3. Restore return address value (from R5 + 2)
        4. Restore old frame pointer value (from R5 + 1)
        5. Return from the function

        Example:

            STR R0, R5, 3 ; Assuming your answer is in R0
            ADD R6, R5, 3
            LDR R7, R5, 2
            LDR R5, R5, 1
            RET

After setting up the stack frame, your function can access the parameters using
R5 at any time since it points to a static location on the stack. For instance,
if our function's header was:

    int foo(int x, int y, int z);

Then the arguments would have been pushed in the order z, y, x which puts x
closer to where R5 points. They can be accessed like so:

    LDR R0, R5, 4 ; R0 = x
    LDR R1, R5, 5 ; R1 = y
    LDR R2, R5, 6 ; R2 = z

Of course, you need to follow the caller side of the calling convention if you
plan to call any functions inside your function, like one would with recursion.


Problem
-------
Implement a function which will sum the digits in a decimal number:

	digisum(4)   = 4
	digisum(34)  = 7
	digisum(714) = 12

To get credit for this lab, you must implement the code in the provided
template, then use the provided XML test to see if your code is correct. Please
use a terminal in the directory with your lab files, and show the output from
the following command to a TA:

lc3test lab13.xml lab13.asm


Pseudocode
----------
int digisum(int n) {
	int div = n / 10;
	int mod = n % 10;
	if(n == 0) {
		return 0;
	} else {
		return mod + digisum(div);
	}
}


Hints
-----
Use the UDIV trap (TRAP x80) to perform division or modulus! Note that UDIV is
a trap, not a function; it doesn't follow the calling convention. Here are the
pre- and post conditions for UDIV:

    Precondition: R0 = X
                  R1 = Y

    Postcondition: R0 = X / Y
                   R1 = X % Y

Your function must follow the LC3 calling convention. This means that the
variables in the above pseudocode "div" and "mod" must explicitly be stored
on the stack regardless of if you can complete this without storing them. The
XML test will test for this!
