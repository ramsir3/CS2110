Objective: Learning about the nuances of using pointers in C
 
Try to collaborate with your classmates if you're stuck, and don'thesitate to
ask the TA's for help. If you are stuck on one part, or not clear about what
it's asking, feel free to ask. Remember, we are here to help you :)



Problem
-------
Fill in the provided template file with the appropriate code to complete the
tests in the code. When you are finished, build the code into an executable
with "make", then run it with "./lab18". Show the results to a TA for credit.



Hints
-----
Remember from HW7/TL4 what happens when you call a function: parameters are
copied onto the stack, so modifying those parameters in the function will only
change their values within that function call. So, you can't just pass in ints
to a swap function. You'll need to pass in something else if you want to change
the original ints.

The man pages are your friend! If you don't know what a function does, then in
a terminal, type "man toupper" or "man strcpy" or whatever the name is.
