===============================================================================
 
Objective: Learn about problems you may encounter with/without pointer use

Try to collaborate with your classmates if you're stuck, and don'thesitate to
ask the TA's for help. If you are stuck on one part, or not clear about what
it's asking, feel free to ask. Remember, we are here to help you :)



Problem
-------
Fill in the provided template file with the appropriate code to complete the
tests in the code. When you are finished, build the code into an executable
with "make", then run it with "./lab21". Show the results to a TA for credit.

Please submit the file lab21.c to Canvas.



Hints
-----
sizeof does NOT give you the number of elements in an array, but it can be USED
to get the number of elements in an array. Google how to do it!

Remember from HW7/TL4 what happens when you call a function: parameters are
copied onto the stack, so modifying those parameters in the function will only
change their values within that function call. So, you can't just pass in ints
to a swap function. You'll need to pass in something else if you want to change
the original ints.

Likewise, if you have a pointer to some data and you copy the value of that
pointer, then you now have two pointers to the same data. What do you think
will happen if you change the value that one pointer points to, then try to
read the value using the other pointer?
