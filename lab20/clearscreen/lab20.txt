Objective: Use DMA to perform memset/memcpy in GBA games
 
This is a lab where you will use DMA in two different ways to copy data on the
GBA.

Note: You may not use the provided .s files for your homework.



DMA on the GBA
--------------
Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a feature cooked into the hardware of the GBA,
whose purpose is to perform fast copies of data in memory. The reason DMA is
fast is because of all the software overhead of having to track index variables
and load from memory multiple times (which is slow, and you'll learn why in CS
2200).

For example, this is the body of the loop in the given clearscreen.c when
assembled into ARM code:

    ldr r3, .L5
    ldr r2, [r3]
    ldr r3, [r7, #4]
    lsl r3, r3, #1
    add r2, r2, r3
    mov r3, #248
    lsl r3, r3, #2
    strh r3, [r2]
    ldr r3, [r7, #4]
    add r3, r3, #1
    str r3, [r7, #4]
    ldr r2, [r7, #4]
    ldr r3, .L5+4
    cmp r2, r3
    ble .L3

All that has to be done for just one copy, but DMA hardware can allow the
copies to be performed in just a few clock cycles instead.

There are 4 channels for performing DMA on the GBA, in decreasing priority:

    0: Timing-critical transfers and internal optimizations
    1: DirectSound A FIFO transfers
    2: DirectSound B FIFO transfers
    3: General purpose transfers

For the purpose of this lab and HW09, you should be using channel 3 to do your
copying. If you choose to put streaming music in your game, you might use
channel 1, or channels 1 and 2 for stereo. Only use channel 0 if you're doing
something highly time-sensitive like hblank transfers (an advanced topic).

DMA works by writing data to 3 locations in memory for that channel. Each
channel has a source address (src), a destination address (dst), and a control
vector (cnt) which tell the hardware respectively where to copy from, where to
copy to, and how to copy.

The src and dst fields must be written first. The control vector will be a
bitwise OR of whichever available options you would like to apply to the
transfer, as well as the number of copies to make. Note that the default copy
size is 16 bits per copy. If you would like to transfer ints instead of shorts,
you can use the DMA_32 flag. You can't transfer individual bytes though.

    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].src = videoBuffer;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * 80;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].cnt = (240 * 80) |
                             DMA_SOURCE_INCREMENT |
                             DMA_DESTINATION_INCREMENT |
                             DMA_ON;

The above example will copy the first half of the videoBuffer into the second
half.

    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].src = videoBuffer + 240 * 80 - 1;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * 80;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].cnt = (240 * 80) |
                             DMA_SOURCE_DECREMENT |
                             DMA_DESTINATION_INCREMENT |
                             DMA_ON;

The above example will copy the first half of the videoBuffer backwards into
the second half.

    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].src = &colorVar;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * 5;
    DMA[DMA_CHANNEL_3].cnt = 240 |
                             DMA_SOURCE_FIXED |
                             DMA_DESTINATION_INCREMENT |
                             DMA_ON;

The above example will set all the pixels in row 5 to the color of colorVar.
Note that src takes an address, not an actual color value! The color needs to
be stored in a variable before it can be used by the DMA controller.



Assignment
----------
In both of the provided C files, edit them appropriately to replace the given
for loops with DMA. main is designed to halt your code after some amount of
time if the drawing code is too slow, so even though the for loop
implementations in the given C file do exactly what we want, they will not be
able to draw the full screen. However, DMA is much faster and will be capable
of drawing it all before time runs out!

    clearscreen:

        An image will be drawn to the screen. Your job is to use DMA to clear
        the screen after it has been drawn. A correct solution won't use any
        iteration at all. You must clear the screen to the color green to get
        credit for this part.

    copydata:

        A fullscreen image and a row number will be passed into the function,
        which should draw the specified row only to the videoBuffer. A correct
        solution won't use any iteration at all.



Hints
-----
If you create a variable to hold a color for a DMA_SOURCE_FIXED transfer and
it seems like the DMA controller is making the screen black instead of whatever
color you wanted, it's probably because the optimizer saw that you're never
reading the value of that variable (just it's address), and so your resulting
object file doesn't contain the store at all. You're going to need to use a
certain keyword Bill talked about in class to force the color value to be
stored in your variable.



Submission Instructions
-----------------------

Please submit all files as a tar archive:

tar -czvf lab20.tar.gz clearscreen copydata

Be sure to practice safe submission! If the above command fails due to being in
the wrong folder, tar will still create the archive, but it will be empty.
