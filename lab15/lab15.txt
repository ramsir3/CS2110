===============================================================================
 
Objective: Learning how to code a simple trap in LC-3 Assembly.
 
Try to collaborate with your classmates if you're stuck, and don'thesitate to
ask the TA's for help. If you are stuck on one part, or not clear about what
it's asking, feel free to ask. Remember, we are here to help you :)

In this lab, you're going to be writing a trap!

BE SURE TO ENABLE TRUE TRAPS IN COMPLX BEFORE YOU RUN YOUR CODE.

Trap Introduction
-----------------
Traps are subroutines that you can call using the TRAP instruction. PUTS, GETC,
OUT, and HALT are all examples of pseudo-operations that assemble to trap
instructions. They work using the Trap Vector Table. 

The Trap Vector Table is an area in memory (x0000 - x00FF) that contains the
addresses of where the data of the trap subroutines are located in memory. For
example, if the code for trap x60 was located at address x7000 in memory, the
corresponding entry in the trap vector table (x60) will contain the value x7000.
When the instruction 'TRAP x60' is executed, the current PC is saved to register
R7, the datapath looks up where trap x60 is located (x7000), the PC is changed
to that value (x7000), the trap executes, and finally, after the trap is done
executing, the PC is changed back to the original value (the one initially
stored in R7).

Problem
-------
Implement a TRAP that makes a character string pointed to by R0 all lowercase.

For instance, if R0 points to the string "Hello World!", the trap should change
its contents to "hello world!". This trap should be callable by writing
TRAP x40 in your code. No registers (except R7) should be modified. You do not
need to conform to any calling conventions.

To get credit for this lab, you must implement the code in the provided
template, then use the provided XML test to see if your code is correct. Please
use a terminal in the directory with your lab files, and show the output from
the following command to a TA:

lc3test lab15.xml lab15.asm


Pseudocode
----------
void lower(char *str) {
    char c = str[0];
    while(c != 0) {
        if(c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
            c += 32;
            str[0] = c;
	}
        string++;
        c = str[0];
    }
}

Hints
-----
If you see "Warning at 0x3007: Unsupported Trap x40." Then enable true traps
from State > True Traps (or just ctrl+T).

Yes, it's normal that your program is halting at address 0x054A. By enabling
true traps, the actual trap code gets processed by complx, and this is the
location where the processor stops in the HALT trap.

The line "char *str" is a parameter that points to the address of the string.

Strings in C and LC3 are null-terminated, meaning that there is a value of zero
zero at the end of the string. Printing functions like printf and PUTS know to stop
printing characters when they reach this value.
